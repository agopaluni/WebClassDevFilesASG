    <h2>Hungry? This is a great recipe for a fantastic spaghetti dish. It's easy to make, takes very little time, and tastes amazing!</h2>

    <h3>Let's gather some ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 serving spaghetti</li>
        <li>½ red onion, diced</li>
        <li>12 kalamata olives, each cut into quarters</li> 
        <li>6 basil leaves, or basil seasoning</li>
        <li>10 cloves of garlic, sliced</li>
        <li>Oregano seasoning</li>
        <li>Crushed red pepper (if you want to add a bit of spice!)</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Now it's time to make it!</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In one pot, cook the spaghetti in boiled water, sprinkling in some salt</li>
        <li>Once the spaghetti seems half cooked, get a skillet and heat up 1 tablespoon of olive oil.</li>
        <li>Once there is some heat, slide your sliced onions and garlic into the skillet. Use a mixing spatula to sauteé the onions and garlic. Keep them on the pan until they are a golden-brown color.</li>
        <li>If the spaghetti is not yet done, turn down the heat on your onion-garlic skillet, and once it is done, turn off both stoves.</li>
        <li>Put the spaghetti in an empty bowl. Slide the olive oil-onion-garlic mixture from the skillet into the bowl with the spaghetti.</li>
        <li>Put the cut olives into the bowl as well, and season with basil, oregano, and crushed red pepper. Add salt to taste. Mix everything together in the bowl with a spoon or fork.</li>
        <li>Once mixed to satisfaction, enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
