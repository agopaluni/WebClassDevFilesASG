            <h1>About</h1>

            <h3>A media company focused on pushing the boundaries of film. We're focused on experimental story ideas,
                combining introspective perspectives with meaningful messages.</h3>

            <h4>About the person: My name is Atharv Gopaluni, and I am a freshman at New York University's Tandon School
                of Engineering. I am an Integrated Design and Media student.

                I was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on May 17th, 2005. I lived in the area for the first 18 years
                of my life. I love the area, with its chilly weather and beautiful falls and winters. Ever since
                childhood, I have been captivated by music and film. I watched my first movie at the age of 6 months
                old, and I come from a lineage of film-lovers as well.

                As part of Tandon School of Engineering, I am learning technical aspects of filmmaking, and am learning
                a large breadth of media techniques. I am working on several personal film projects that I hope to soon
                put out into the world.</h4>

            <h4>About the company: APEX Media Company was founded in 2023 by Atharv Gopaluni. There are several projects
