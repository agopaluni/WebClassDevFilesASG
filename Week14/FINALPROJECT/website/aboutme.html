            <h1>About</h1>

            <h3>A media company focused on pushing the boundaries of film. We're focused on experimental story ideas,
                combining introspective perspectives with meaningful messages.</h3>

            <h4>About the person: My name is Atharv Gopaluni, and I am a freshman at New York University's Tandon School
                of Engineering. I am an Integrated Design and Media student.

                I was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on May 17th, 2005. I lived in the area for the first 18 years
                of my life. I love the area, with its chilly weather and beautiful falls and winters. Ever since
                childhood, I have been captivated by music and film. I watched my first movie at the age of 6 months
                old, and I come from a lineage of film-lovers as well.

                As part of Tandon School of Engineering, I am learning technical aspects of filmmaking, and am learning
                a large breadth of media techniques. I am working on several personal film projects that I hope to soon
                put out into the world.</h4>

            <h4>About the company: APEX Media Company was founded in 2023 by Atharv Gopaluni. There are several projects
                under APEX, including films under the subsidiary APEX Studios and podcasts under the larger umbrella
                APEX Media. APEX seeks to constantly continue creating, there are several projects in the pipeline,
                including a series of short films to come out on YouTube</h4>
